  "summary": "Diff adds a new utility to map privilege names to Tailwind class overrides and wires it into FieldServiceGroupProfile, but the evidence does not show app-wide adoption. The utility also adds non-background styling changes (text color and hover styles), which conflicts with the constraint to change only background colors.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Apply the Elder (#7C3AED) and Ministerial Servant (#2563EB) privilege badge background color changes across the app anywhere privilege badges are rendered (including publishers lists on Field Service Group profile pages).",
      "reason": "The diff only shows usage/import in FieldServiceGroupProfile; no evidence of updating other pages/components where privilege badges may be rendered (e.g., publishers list page, publisher profile, other lists).",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Keep all other badge styling exactly the same (no changes besides background color: padding, border radius, font weight, size, etc.).",
      "reason": "The new className overrides include `text-white` and `hover:bg[...]` which change non-background styling/behavior beyond just the background color.",

      "description": "Privilege badge overrides also force white text (`text-white`) and add hover background classes (`hover:bg[...]`).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only asked to change the Elder/Ministerial Servant badge background colors and explicitly disallowed other styling changes.",
