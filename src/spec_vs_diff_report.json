  "summary": "The diff shows partial work toward making Publisher dropdowns scrollable by adding a max-height class to SelectContent in at least two modals (AddPioneerModal, RecordVisitModal). However, based on the truncated snippets, it is not verifiable that all four specified modals were updated, nor that overflow/scrollbar behavior and off-screen containment/repositioning are implemented. Additionally, there is an unrelated change in the PublicWitnessing page (sorting) that was not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "In each of the four specified modals, the Publisher dropdown list has a maximum height of 250px, becomes vertically scrollable with a scrollbar when exceeding that height, and repositions/constrains so it does not render off-screen or visually escape the modal/viewport.",
      "reason": "Only two modals explicitly show `SelectContent className=\"max-h-[250px]\"` in the provided diff (AddPioneerModal, RecordVisitModal). The TrainedPublisherModal and ConductorModal portions containing the Publisher SelectContent are truncated, so it cannot be confirmed they were updated. Also, `max-h-[250px]` alone does not, by itself, prove overflow scrolling (e.g., `overflow-y-auto`) or off-screen containment/repositioning behavior was implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/pioneers/AddPioneerModal.tsx (shows `SelectContent className=\"max-h-[250px]\"` but no explicit overflow/reposition props in shown snippet)",
