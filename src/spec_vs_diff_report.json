  "summary": "CSV export utility and export handler logic were added, including client-side CSV generation, escaping, and download as pioneers-export.csv. However, the diff excerpt does not show the Pioneers page header JSX changes, so the presence/placement/styling of the new \"Export to CSV\" button cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. Some additional behaviors (e.g., sorting export rows alphabetically and toast notifications) were implemented but not explicitly requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add an \"Export to CSV\" button to the Pioneers page header, positioned in the top-right next to the existing \"Add Pioneer\" button.",
      "reason": "The modified Pioneers page file is truncated before the rendered header/JSX, so there is no evidence in the diff summary that a new button is actually rendered in the header next to \"Add Pioneer\" (or that it is only present on this page).",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Style the new \"Export to CSV\" button to match the existing \"Add Pioneer\" button styling but be visually distinct (secondary treatment and/or download icon), with no other styling changes.",
      "reason": "While a download icon import is shown, the diff summary does not include the JSX where the button is rendered nor any className/variant props demonstrating styling parity/distinction; therefore this requirement cannot be verified from the provided diff excerpt.",

      "description": "Sort exported CSV rows alphabetically by pioneer name before generating/downloading the CSV.",

      "description": "Toast notifications for export success/failure and \"No data to export\".",
