  "summary": "Diff shows new alert-related computations added to Dashboard.tsx (overdue tasks count; overdue territories count based on active checkout duration in months) and TanStack Router Link import, but the file is truncated before any JSX confirming the new \"Alerts\" section rendering, exact user-facing strings, styling, placement below Recent Activity, and the required links.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Render a new \"Alerts\" section titled \"Alerts\" directly below the existing \"Recent Activity\" section on the Dashboard, using consistent spacing/card styling, without changing existing Dashboard content/behavior beyond insertion.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt only shows added imports and alert/stat computation logic; it does not include the JSX that renders an \"Alerts\" heading/section or its placement below the full Recent Activity section. Because the file is truncated before the render area, implementation cannot be confirmed from provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "In the new \"Alerts\" section: show (1) a red alert box \"X territories overdue for return\" linking to \"/territories\" when any territories are checked out for >=4 months; (2) an orange alert box \"X overdue tasks\" linking to \"/tasks\" when any tasks are overdue (dueDate past and not completed); (3) otherwise show muted gray text \"No alerts\"; show both alert items if both conditions true; exact strings required.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows computation for overdueTerritoriesCount and overdueTasksCount and imports Link and alert icons, but does not show any rendered alert UI, exact strings, styling (red/orange/muted), or the required navigation links/routes. Truncation prevents verification that these acceptance criteria are implemented.",
