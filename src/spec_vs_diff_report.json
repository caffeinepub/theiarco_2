  "summary": "Diff focuses on adding frontend error handling/auth UI changes and substantial new backend domain logic (profiles/publishers), but it does not show any build/deploy retry, captured deployment error output, or targeted minimal fix explicitly tied to a deployment failure. Several changes appear to be new product functionality unrelated to resolving a deployment failure.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Retry the build + deployment using the existing ICP build/deploy templates and current project configuration, targeting the same environment/canisters as the previous failed attempt.",
      "reason": "The diff contains only code/config changes (frontend/backend). There is no evidence of a deployment retry run, nor any changes to deploy templates/config to ensure targeting the same environment/canisters.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "If the deployment fails again, capture the full error output (including the failing command and stack trace/logs) and implement the minimal project change(s) needed to resolve the root cause, then re-run deployment until it succeeds.",
      "reason": "No deployment logs/error output are included in the diff summary, and no changes are clearly identified as a minimal fix for a specific captured deployment error (failing command/stack trace not shown).",
