  "summary": "Frontend CRUD UI for conductors (modal, table, delete confirmation, React Query hooks) was implemented, but the backend/domain CRUD + migration work is not evidenced in the diff. Additionally, the React Query cache key used is ['trainedConductors'] rather than the required ['serviceMeetingConductors'], which may prevent required invalidation/refetch behavior per spec.",
