  "summary": "Frontend routing and a new Service Meeting Conductors page were added, including an Assign Conductor button, loading UI, empty-state message, and React Query hook. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the backend query API and stable storage are fully implemented in backend/main.mo, nor that generated frontend backend bindings were updated. Additionally, the page only renders the table when assignments exist, which may not satisfy the requirement to include a table with the specified columns on the page in the empty state.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Page includes a table with columns \"Week Of\", \"Conductor Name\", and \"Actions\".",
      "reason": "In the new page implementation, the table is only rendered when conductors.length > 0. When the backend returns zero assignments, only the empty-state message is rendered, so the table (and its headers/columns) is not present in that state.",

      "requirement": "Backend adds a new stable-persisted collection for service meeting conductor assignments and provides a query method to list all assignments with fields: id, weekOf, conductorId, conductorName, createdAt.",
      "reason": "Although a migration module adds a new serviceMeetingConductors field to the migrated state, the provided truncated backend/main.mo diff does not show the stable variable/field declaration and does not show any query method such as getAllServiceMeetingConductors that returns the specified record array.",

      "requirement": "Expose the new backend query in generated frontend backend bindings and consume it from the Service Meeting Conductors page.",
      "reason": "The frontend hook calls actor.getAllServiceMeetingConductors() and imports ServiceMeetingConductor from '../backend', but the diff summary does not show any changes to the generated bindings (e.g., a candid/actor binding file) that would add the method/type. The backend method itself is also not evidenced in the provided backend diff.",
