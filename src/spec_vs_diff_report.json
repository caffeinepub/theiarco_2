  "summary": "The diff implements the requested Publisher Profile page: it adds an authenticated route at `/publishers/$id`, makes publisher names navigate to that route, adds a profile page UI with required fields, includes a back button, and adds a React Query hook to fetch a single publisher with loading and not-found states. No missing requirements are evident from the provided diff summary, but there are a couple of additional UI elements not explicitly requested (inactive badge, possibly notes).",
