Evidence for REQ-2 (Publisher table Overseer/Assistant badge class alignment) is inconclusive from the provided truncated diff, and there are indications of additional Publishers page theming changes beyond the requested badge styling update.",

      "reason": "The diff snippet for frontend/src/pages/Publishers.tsx is truncated before any badge rendering/classes are shown, so the required Tailwind class alignment and hover behavior changes cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
