  "summary": "Territories.tsx adds logic to derive a publisher display value using the most recent checkout record and fetches publishers via useGetAllPublishers, but the diff snippet does not show the actual table header/cell insertion or muted styling, so key UI placement/styling requirements cannot be verified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the Territories table to include a new \"Publisher\" column positioned between \"Territory Number\" and \"Status\" (header and row cells), keeping all other behaviors unchanged.",
      "reason": "The provided diff excerpt for Territories.tsx is truncated before the table JSX, so there is no visible evidence that a \"Publisher\" <TableHead> and corresponding <TableCell> were added or that column order was adjusted.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/Territories.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "When status is \"Available\", display exactly \"—\" in a muted/gray text style (e.g., text-muted-foreground) in the Publisher cell; fail gracefully with muted \"—\" if checked out but no record is found.",
      "reason": "The logic returns \"—\" for Available and missing-record cases, but the diff excerpt does not show any JSX/styling applying a muted/gray class to the rendered em dash in the table cell.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Introduced an additional helper to compute an \"active\" checkout record (most recent record with dateReturned null/undefined), which may affect duration calculation behavior.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to add a Publisher column derived from the most recent checkout record; adding/altering logic around the active checkout record is not requested and could potentially change existing page behavior.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/Territories.tsx (truncated) - getActiveCheckoutRecord helper added"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Publisher display logic explicitly returns an em dash for statuses other than \"Available\" and \"Checked Out\" (e.g., \"Under Review\").",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest specifies behavior for \"Checked Out\" and \"Available\" only; handling other statuses this way is additional behavior not explicitly requested (though it may be acceptable).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/Territories.tsx (truncated) - getPublisherName returns '—' for other statuses"
