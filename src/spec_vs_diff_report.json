  "summary": "A new shared PrivilegeBadge component was added with the specified Elder/Ministerial Servant colors, and FieldServiceGroupProfile.tsx was updated to import it. However, the diff does not show that all existing badge render locations across the app were updated to use the shared implementation, nor that the listed pages (Publishers, Publisher Profile, Field Service Groups list/profile, Pioneers) were comprehensively updated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Create a single, shared privilege badge styling implementation for the \"Elder\" and \"Ministerial Servant\" badges, and use it everywhere these privilege badges are rendered in the UI so the styling is consistent across pages.",
      "reason": "A shared component (PrivilegeBadge) was added, but the diff only shows it being imported in FieldServiceGroupProfile.tsx; there is no evidence that all other locations rendering these privilege badges were switched to use this shared implementation.",

        "frontend/src/components/publishers/PrivilegeBadge.tsx",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Update Elder and Ministerial Servant badge background colors everywhere they appear: Elder must use #7C3AED and Ministerial Servant must use #2563EB; badge text must remain white; do not introduce dark-mode variants for these badges.",
      "reason": "The new PrivilegeBadge component uses the correct hex colors and white text with no dark-mode variants, but the diff does not demonstrate that every existing Elder/Ministerial Servant badge instance throughout the UI has been updated to use it (or otherwise updated) so the colors are applied everywhere.",

      "requirement": "Apply the updated Elder/Ministerial Servant badge styling in all the known pages where they appear (Publishers page table, Publisher profile page, Field Service Groups page publisher lists, Field Service Group profile page publisher lists, Pioneers page table) and any other UI location that displays these privilege badges next to publisher names.",
      "reason": "Only FieldServiceGroupProfile.tsx is shown as modified (and only with an import in the truncated diff). There is no evidence of updates to the other explicitly listed pages (Publishers, PublisherProfile, Field Service Groups page/list, Pioneers) or any other locations where privilege badges may appear.",
