# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make Publisher dropdown option lists scrollable and visually contained within their modals, with a maximum dropdown height of 250px.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Publisher dropdown usage in the Add Pioneer modal to constrain the dropdown list to max-height: 250px, enable vertical scrolling, and keep it within the modal/viewport.
- Update the Publisher dropdown usage in the Record Visit modal to constrain the dropdown list to max-height: 250px, enable vertical scrolling, and keep it within the modal/viewport.
- Update the Publisher dropdown usage in the Add Conductor modal to constrain the dropdown list to max-height: 250px, enable vertical scrolling, and keep it within the modal/viewport.
- Update the Publisher dropdown usage in the Add Trained Publisher modal to constrain the dropdown list to max-height: 250px, enable vertical scrolling, and keep it within the modal/viewport.

**User-visible outcome:** In all four modals, long Publisher dropdown lists show a scrollbar and remain contained within the modal/viewport instead of extending off-screen, while all other behavior and UI remains unchanged.
