# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update privilege badge background colors for “Elder” and “Ministerial Servant” across the app without changing any other badge styling.

**Planned changes:**
- Set the “Elder” PRIVILEGE badge background color to Amethyst Purple (#7C3AED) wherever it appears next to publisher names.
- Set the “Ministerial Servant” PRIVILEGE badge background color to Sapphire Blue (#2563EB) wherever it appears next to publisher names.
- Ensure “Overseer” and “Assistant” Field Service Group leadership role badges remain unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Wherever privilege badges appear (including on Field Service Group profile pages), “Elder” badges display with a #7C3AED background and “Ministerial Servant” badges display with a #2563EB background, with all other badge styling and other badge types unchanged.
