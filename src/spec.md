# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Darken Field Service Group 3’s green across the app and make the Publishers table Overseer/Assistant badges visually match the badges used on Field Service Group profile pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the centralized Field Service Group color mapping so Group 3 uses hex `#0B6623`, ensuring all UI consumers of Group 3’s color reflect the change (main Field Service Groups page and Group 3 profile page elements, including the Record Visit button).
- Update the Publishers page table’s Overseer and Assistant badges to use the same Tailwind classes (background, text, hover behavior) as the corresponding badges on the Field Service Group profile page.

**User-visible outcome:** Group 3 displays with a darker green everywhere its color is used, and Overseer/Assistant badges in the Publishers table look consistent with the badge styling on Field Service Group profile pages.
